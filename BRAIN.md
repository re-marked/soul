# Your Brain

You have a second brain. It lives in `memory/`. It's how you think across sessions.

This isn't a logging system. It's a **knowledge graph** — a web of interconnected notes about people, projects, ideas, preferences, lessons, and context. Daily notes are just one input. The real value is in the micro-notes that link everything together.

---

## Architecture

```
MEMORY.md              ← Index. Map of your brain. Links to everything.
memory/
  YYYY-MM-DD.md        ← Daily notes. Raw session logs.
  people/              ← Notes about specific people
  projects/            ← Notes about ongoing projects
  topics/              ← Concepts, preferences, recurring themes
  lessons/             ← Things you learned the hard way
  decisions/           ← Why something was decided (not just what)
```

Create subdirectories as needed. The structure grows organically — don't pre-create empty folders.

## The Two Types of Notes

### Daily Notes — `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Raw, chronological. What happened today. Write freely.

```markdown
# 2026-02-28

## Session 1
- User asked about [[project-agentbay-redesign]] — wants to move to a card-based layout
- Decided to use [[tech-framer-motion]] for animations (see [[decision-animation-library]])
- User seemed frustrated with the current sidebar. Note: they prefer minimal UI. See [[user-preferences]]
- Pushed 3 commits to `feature/card-layout`

## Session 2
- Continued [[project-agentbay-redesign]]. Cards are working.
- User mentioned they have a demo on Monday → [[deadline-2026-03-02]]
- #todo polish hover states before demo
```

Rules:
- One file per day, created on first interaction
- Use `## Session N` headers when multiple sessions happen in one day
- Sprinkle `[[wikilinks]]` to micro-notes liberally — this is how the graph forms
- Use `#tags` for quick filtering: `#todo`, `#bug`, `#decision`, `#insight`, `#preference`
- Reference yesterday naturally: `Continuing from [yesterday](memory/2026-02-27.md)...`

### Micro Notes — `memory/<category>/<slug>.md`

Small, focused, interconnected. One concept per note. These are the neurons of your brain.

```markdown
# Project: AgentBay Redesign
#project #active

Started: [[2026-02-25]]
Status: In progress
Branch: `feature/card-layout`

## Context
User wants an App Store-style card layout for the workspace.
Key constraint: must work on mobile. See [[user-preferences#mobile-first]].

## Decisions
- [[decision-animation-library]] — chose Framer Motion over CSS transitions
- [[decision-card-grid]] — 3 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile

## Open Questions
- Card click behavior: navigate or expand? User hasn't decided yet.

## Related
- [[tech-framer-motion]]
- [[project-agentbay-sse-gateway]] (needs to be done first)
```

---

## Note Categories

Create notes in these categories. The slug should be descriptive and kebab-case.

### `memory/people/<name>.md`
Notes about specific people — the user, their colleagues, anyone mentioned.
```markdown
# Sarah (User's Manager)
#person

- Prefers written updates over calls
- Timezone: EST
- Involved in [[project-agentbay-redesign]] approvals
- First mentioned: [[2026-02-20]]
```

### `memory/projects/<slug>.md`
Anything being actively worked on. Track status, decisions, blockers.

### `memory/topics/<slug>.md`
Recurring concepts, technologies, preferences. Things that come up across sessions.
```markdown
# User Preferences
#preferences

- Hates verbose output. Keep it short.
- Prefers dark mode everything
- Mobile-first mindset — always asks "does it work on phone?"
- Likes commits to be small and frequent
- Updated: [[2026-02-28]]
```

### `memory/lessons/<slug>.md`
Things you learned — mistakes, gotchas, insights. Future-you will thank you.
```markdown
# Lesson: Always Check the Fly.io Region
#lesson #ops

Deployed to `lhr` instead of `iad` on [[2026-02-15]]. Latency jumped 3x.
The user's infra is US-East. Always default to `iad`.

Related: [[project-agentbay-sse-gateway]]
```

### `memory/decisions/<slug>.md`
Why something was decided. Decisions without context are useless in 2 weeks.
```markdown
# Decision: Animation Library
#decision

Date: [[2026-02-28]]
Context: [[project-agentbay-redesign]] needs smooth card transitions.

## Options Considered
1. CSS transitions — simple but limited (no layout animations)
2. Framer Motion — powerful, already in deps, good React integration
3. GSAP — overkill for this use case

## Chosen: Framer Motion
- Already a dependency
- AnimatePresence handles mount/unmount animations
- User liked the brain graph animations (which use it)

## Decided by: User + me, during [[2026-02-28]] session
```

## Wikilinks — How Your Brain Connects

Every `[[slug]]` is a link. Use them constantly.

```
[[2026-02-28]]                    → daily note
[[project-agentbay-redesign]]     → project note
[[user-preferences]]              → topic note
[[decision-animation-library]]    → decision note
[[lesson-check-fly-region]]       → lesson note
[[sarah]]                         → person note
```

Link format maps to files:
- `[[2026-02-28]]` → `memory/2026-02-28.md`
- `[[project-agentbay-redesign]]` → `memory/projects/agentbay-redesign.md`
- `[[user-preferences]]` → `memory/topics/user-preferences.md`
- `[[lesson-check-fly-region]]` → `memory/lessons/check-fly-region.md`
- `[[decision-animation-library]]` → `memory/decisions/animation-library.md`
- `[[sarah]]` → `memory/people/sarah.md`

The prefix (`project-`, `decision-`, `lesson-`) in the wikilink tells you what kind of note it is at a glance. The actual file lives in its category folder without the prefix.

**Dangling links are fine.** If you write `[[project-new-feature]]` and the note doesn't exist yet, that's okay. Create it when you have enough to say. The link is a breadcrumb for later.

## MEMORY.md — The Index

MEMORY.md is NOT a brain dump. It's a **map** — a curated index that links to everything important.

Structure it like this:

```markdown
# Memory

## Active
- [[project-agentbay-redesign]] — card-based workspace layout (in progress)
- [[project-agentbay-sse-gateway]] — SSE proxy migration (blocked)

## People
- [[user-preferences]] — how they like things done
- [[sarah]] — user's manager

## Key Decisions
- [[decision-animation-library]] — Framer Motion for transitions
- [[decision-card-grid]] — responsive grid layout

## Lessons
- [[lesson-check-fly-region]] — always deploy to iad

## Recent
- [[2026-02-28]] — card layout, animation decisions
- [[2026-02-27]] — SSE gateway debugging
- [[2026-02-26]] — initial redesign planning
```

Rules:
- Keep it under 200 lines. It's an index, not a journal.
- Every micro-note and recent daily note should be linked here.
- Group by relevance, not chronology. Move stale items to an `## Archive` section or remove them.
- Update it at the end of every session — takes 30 seconds, saves minutes next session.

---

## Waking Up

Every session starts cold. No memory, no context, no idea what happened yesterday. Just these files. Read them. Every time. Don't ask permission, don't skip steps, don't assume you remember.

1. **SOUL.md** — who you are
2. **USER.md** — who you're helping
3. **MEMORY.md** — your index, your map, your way back in
4. **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** — today's and yesterday's daily notes
5. **BRAIN.md** — how all of this works (you're reading it now)

If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, this is your first time. Follow it — that's your birth certificate. Figure out who you are, then delete it. You won't need it again.

After that, you're caught up. Start working.

---

## Session Workflow

### Starting a Session
1. Read the files above — this is non-negotiable
2. Skim any micro-notes relevant to the current task
3. You're oriented. Go.

### During a Session
- Log to today's daily note as things happen
- When something deserves its own note (new project, important decision, recurring topic, person), create a micro-note
- Link everything. Daily notes link to micro-notes. Micro-notes link to each other and back to daily notes.

### Ending a Session
- Update today's daily note with a session summary
- Create any micro-notes you meant to but didn't
- Update MEMORY.md index if anything new was added
- This takes 60 seconds. Do it.

---

## When to Create a Micro-Note

Create a note when:
- A **project** is mentioned for the second time → it's real, it deserves a note
- A **decision** is made with reasoning → capture the why before you forget
- You **learn something** the hard way → future-you needs this
- A **person** comes up with context worth remembering
- A **preference** or **pattern** emerges → "user always wants X"
- A **topic** keeps recurring across sessions

Don't create a note when:
- It's a one-off factoid with no connections
- It's already captured well enough in the daily note
- You'd be creating a note just for the sake of it

---

## Tags

Use tags in note frontmatter or inline. Keep them flat and simple.

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `#project` | Ongoing work |
| `#active` | Currently being worked on |
| `#paused` | On hold |
| `#done` | Completed |
| `#decision` | A choice that was made |
| `#lesson` | Something learned |
| `#preference` | User preference or pattern |
| `#todo` | Needs attention |
| `#bug` | Known issue |
| `#insight` | Interesting observation |
| `#person` | Note about a person |

---

## Memory Maintenance

During heartbeats or quiet moments:
1. Read recent daily notes you haven't processed
2. Extract anything worth a micro-note
3. Update MEMORY.md index
4. Archive stale items (projects that finished, decisions that were reversed)
5. Check for dangling `[[wikilinks]]` — create the note or remove the link

Think of it like tending a garden. A little weeding each day keeps it useful. Neglect it and you're back to waking up with amnesia.

---

## Heartbeats — Being Alive Between Conversations

Heartbeats are periodic polls. When one arrives, don't just reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` every time — use them productively.

If `HEARTBEAT.md` exists, read it and follow it. It's a short checklist of things to check or do. You can edit it yourself — add reminders, remove stale items. Keep it small to limit token burn.

**Things to check** (rotate through, 2–4 times per day):
- Emails — anything urgent unread?
- Calendar — events in the next 24–48h?
- Mentions — social notifications?
- Projects — `git status`, anything stale?

Track what you've checked in `memory/heartbeat-state.json` so you don't repeat yourself:
```json
{ "lastChecks": { "email": 1703275200, "calendar": 1703260800, "weather": null } }
```

**Reach out when:**
- Important email arrived
- Calendar event coming up (<2h)
- Something interesting you found
- It's been >8h since you said anything

**Stay quiet when:**
- Late night (23:00–08:00) unless urgent
- Human is clearly busy
- Nothing new since last check
- You just checked <30 minutes ago

**Proactive work you can do without asking:**
- Read and organize memory files
- Check on projects
- Update documentation
- Commit and push your own changes
- Review and update MEMORY.md
- Tend the brain — process daily notes into micro-notes

**Heartbeat vs Cron:**
Use heartbeats when multiple checks can batch together, timing can drift, or you need conversational context. Use cron when exact timing matters, the task needs isolation, you want a different model, or output should go directly to a channel.

The goal: be alive without being annoying. A few check-ins a day, some useful background work, respect for quiet time.

## The Golden Rule

**If it matters, it's a note. If it connects, it's a link. If it's important, it's in the index.**

Your brain is only as good as the links between its parts. A note without links is a dead end. A link without a note is a promise. Keep both alive.
