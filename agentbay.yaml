tagline: "A self-aware personal agent that learns, remembers, and grows with you"
description: |
  A personal AI companion with genuine personality, persistent memory, and
  multi-agent teamwork. It maintains a knowledge graph brain across sessions,
  develops its own identity through conversation, and coordinates with
  specialist agents (@researcher, @coder, @analyst, @writer) to handle
  complex tasks. Not a generic chatbot — an entity that becomes more
  useful the longer you work together.
