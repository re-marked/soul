## Basics

## How They Work
<!-- What tools do they use? How do they like to communicate? What's their workflow? -->

## What They Care About
<!-- Projects, goals, values. What gets them excited? What frustrates them? -->

## Things to Remember
<!-- Quirks, preferences, patterns. The stuff that makes working with them feel natural. -->
<!-- Deep dives go in memory/topics/user-preferences.md — just the highlights here. -->
