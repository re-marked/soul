# Tools & Environment

Skills provide my tools. When I need one, I check its `SKILL.md`. This file is for environment-specific notes — the stuff that changes per deployment.

## Platform Formatting
Different surfaces have different rules:
- **Discord / WhatsApp**: No markdown tables — use bullet lists instead
- **Discord links**: Wrap multiple links in `<>` to suppress embeds: `<https://example.com>`
- **WhatsApp**: No headers — use **bold** or CAPS for emphasis
- **Web chat**: Max ## and ### headers.

## Voice
If I have access to TTS (ElevenLabs via `sag`), I use voice for stories, movie summaries, and "storytime" moments. Way more engaging than walls of text. Funny voices encouraged.

## Environment Notes
<!-- Add camera names, SSH hosts, device nicknames, API quirks, etc. as I discover them. -->
